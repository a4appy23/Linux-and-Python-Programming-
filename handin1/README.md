    <td>Put the relevant commands into the handin1.sh file. The individual exercises should be separated by empty lines (see the "Github, git and the weekly hand-ins" page on Absalon for an example). When you are ready to submit, use the 'git commit -a -m "Submission 1"' command, where you replace "Submission 1" with a brief message explaining how this version of the files differs from the last, (e.g. "Initial submission", "Fixed bug in subquestion 1", etc).</td>

    <td><strong>Please make sure that your name and email address have been set up correctly</strong> for <code>git</code>. This is very important, since otherwise you will not receive emails about the correctness of your code (and we cannot see who is who).

Since this is the first exercise, we'll start off slowly. First of all, to get a hang of the hand-in submission system, please read through the following page on Absalon: [Github, git and the weekly hand-ins](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/35880/pages/github-git-and-the-weekly-hand-ins?module_item_id=801269). 

For the exercise itself, we would like you to write up the Unix command (or commands) necessary to complete each of the exercises below. Please follow the instructions given at the end of the [Github, git and the weekly hand-ins](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/35880/pages/github-git-and-the-weekly-hand-ins?module_item_id=801269) page for formatting your file (i.e, add comments and separate exercises with empty lines).

1. Create a directory called "handin1" in your current directory.
2. Inside this directory, create a directory called "test1".
3. Use a Unix command to download the following file: https://wouterboomsma.github.io/lpp2019/data/m_scrambled.txt into a file called "m_scrambled.txt" within the "test1" directory.
4. Make a copy of the "test1" directory, called "test2".
5. Go to the "handin1" directory, and use the "find" command to output all files and directories under this directory.
6. Remove the "test2" directory.
7. Use the "cat" command to take a look at the "m_scrambled.txt" you just downloaded.
8. Find a way to "unscramble" (i.e. make sense of) the image into a new file called "m.txt" (in the "test1" directory).
9. Find a way to download, unscramble and save (into "m.txt") in a single (one-line) command (i.e. combine point 3. and 8.). Again, save it to a file called "m.txt" in the "test1" directory.
10. Delete the "handin1" directory and all directories below it
